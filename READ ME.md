![Design preview for the Chat app CSS illustration coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! 👋

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

**To do this challenge, you need a strong understanding of HTML and CSS.**

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this feature illustration using HTML & CSS and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

The only assets we provide in this challenge are the image of the person in the app UI and the 3 images of the dog. You need to create everything else using HTML & CSS!

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- **Bonus**: See the chat interface animate on the initial load

Want some support on the challenge? [Join our Slack community](https://www.frontendmentor.io/slack) and ask questions in the **#help** channel.

## Where to find everything
تتمثل مهمتك في بناء المشروع للتصميمات داخل مجلد "/التصميم".ستجد كل من الهاتف المحمول وسطح المكتب من التصميم.

التصميمات بتنسيق ثابت JPG.سيعني استخدام JPGS أنك ستحتاج إلى استخدام أفضل حكمك لأنماط مثل "حجم الخط" و "الحشو" و "الهامش".

إذا كنت ترغب في الحصول على ملفات التصميم (نقدم إصدارات Sketch & Figma) لتفقد التصميم بمزيد من التفصيل ، فيمكنك [الاشتراك كعضو محترف] (https://www.frontendmentor.io/pro).

ستجد جميع الأصول المطلوبة في مجلد "/صور".تم تحسين الأصول بالفعل.

يوجد أيضًا ملف `style-side.md` يحتوي على المعلومات التي ستحتاجها ، مثل لوحة الألوان والخطوط.

## Building your project

Feel free to use any workflow that you feel comfortable with. Below is a suggested process, but do not feel like you need to follow these steps:

1. قم بتهيئة مشروعك كمستودع عام على [github] (https://github.com/). سيجعل إنشاء Repo من السهل مشاركة الكود الخاص بك مع المجتمع إذا كنت بحاجة إلى مساعدة. إذا لم تكن متأكدًا من كيفية القيام بذلك ، [لديك قراءة من هذا جرب GIT Resource] (https://try.github.io/).
2. قم بتكوين مستودعك لنشر الكود على عنوان ويب. سيكون هذا مفيدًا أيضًا إذا كنت بحاجة إلى بعض المساعدة أثناء التحدي حيث يمكنك مشاركة عنوان URL لمشروعك باستخدام عنوان URL الخاص بك. هناك عدد من الطرق للقيام بذلك ، ونقدم بعض التوصيات أدناه.
3. ابحث عن التصميمات لبدء التخطيط لكيفية معالجة المشروع. هذه الخطوة أمر بالغ الأهمية لمساعدتك على التفكير في فصول CSS لإنشاء أنماط قابلة لإعادة الاستخدام.
4. قبل إضافة أي أنماط ، بنية المحتوى الخاص بك باستخدام HTML. يمكن أن تساعد كتابة HTML أولاً في تركيز انتباهك على إنشاء محتوى جيد التنظيم.
5. اكتب الأنماط الأساسية لمشروعك ، بما في ذلك أنماط المحتوى العام ، مثل "Font-Family" و "حجم الخط".
6. ابدأ في إضافة أنماط إلى أعلى الصفحة والعمل لأسفل. انتقل فقط إلى القسم التالي بمجرد أن تكون سعيدًا لأنك أكملت المنطقة التي تعمل عليها.

## Deploying your project

As mentioned above, there are many ways to host your project for free. Our recommend hosts are:

- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

You can host your site using one of these solutions or any of our other trusted providers. [Read more about our recommended and trusted hosts](https://medium.com/frontend-mentor/frontend-mentor-trusted-hosting-providers-bf000dfebe).

## Create a custom `README.md`

We strongly recommend overwriting this `README.md` with a custom one. We've provided a template inside the [`README-template.md`](./README-template.md) file in this starter code.

The template provides a guide for what to add. A custom `README` will help you explain your project and reflect on your learnings. Please feel free to edit our template as much as you like.

Once you've added your information to the template, delete this file and rename the `README-template.md` file to `README.md`. That will make it show up as your repository's README file.

## Submitting your solution
